# Analyzing-Batting-Performance-and-Platoon-Advantage-in-the-2022-MLB-Season-Using-Statcast-Data

Summary of Key Results:
•	Line drives (10-25 degrees), hit with higher exit velocity, had the highest BA and wOBA, showing the importance of both metrics in identifying well-hit balls.
•	Platoon advantage was clear in both BA and wOBA metrics, with left-handed hitters performing better against right-handed pitchers, and vice versa.
•	wOBA provided deeper insights into offensive value than BA, particularly in capturing the value of extra-base hits and higher-quality contact.
These results provide both a data-driven validation of well-known baseball principles (e.g., platoon advantage, the value of line drives) and a more granular understanding of offensive production through advanced metrics like wOBA.
